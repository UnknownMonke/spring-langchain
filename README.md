# LangChain4j Demo

## Overview

- Some fooling around with [LangChain4j](https://github.com/langchain4j) for AI agents.

- Uses a local Ollama instance running separately.

  - Can also run within the application using [test containers](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/integrations/language-models/ollama/).
